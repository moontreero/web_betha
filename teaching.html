    Although Jupyter notebooks are extensively used worldwide for both teaching and research, their use at Uppsala University is—especially when it comes to teaching—not 
    as widespread as expected from a world-leading higher education institution. Thus, the project Jupyter4UU arose from the idea that Uppsala University 
    could benefit from further integrating Jupyter notebooks into its curriculum and research practices, aligning more closely with the advancements seen 
    globally at other top universities in the world.<br>
            
        On this basis, during year 2023 I coordinated the Jupyter4UU project, whose objective was to change this scenario at Uppsala University. Recognizing the potential of Jupyter notebooks to revolutionize teaching and learning, 
        I initiated this project to promote their widespread adoption within our educational community. Through a series of targeted workshops, 
        hands-on training sessions, and the development of accessible resources, my aim has been to equip educators with the skills and knowledge needed to integrate Jupyter notebooks into their courses.<br>
       
    Furthermore, Jupyter4UU aimed to promote the use of open-source tools, such as Jupyter and Python, over proprietary tools like MATLAB, 
            aligning with both worldwide trends and Uppsala University's policies. This shift is not solely about eliminating paywalls 
            (financial barriers associated with proprietary software), ensuring that all students and educators, regardless of their economic 
            background, have equal access to the necessary technological resources. It is also about the substantial advantages in terms of 
            accessibility, openness, and reproducibility of results.<br>

  Indeed, the transparency inherent in open-source tools enables an environment of openness, 
            which is critical for scientific research and education. Jupyter notebooks facilitate
            collaborative efforts across different disciplines and institutions and are, therefore, 
            crucial skills for the future professional development of our educators and students.<br>

            By adopting open source tools, we also become part of a community that values transparency 
            and shared information. This community-driven approach encourages continuous improvement and innovation, 
            as users can contribute to its development. Engaging with this community helps educators and students stay at the 
            forefront of technological advancements and pedagogical practices, promoting a culture of lifelong learning and collaboration.
